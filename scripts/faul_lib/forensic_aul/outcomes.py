"""Return-value containers for the top-level operations.

Defines : the result dataclasses returned by the library's main entry points —
          ``ExtractResult`` (run_extract), ``DiffResult`` (run_diff) and
          ``ExportResult`` (run_export). They bundle the output path(s) with the
          facts a caller would otherwise have to re-query, so calls chain cleanly:

              res = run_extract(src, "case.db", case_number="C1")
              annotate_database(res.db_path, kb)      # reuse the path, no re-query

Used by : forensic_aul.ops.extraction.extract, forensic_aul.ops.identify.diff,
          forensic_aul.ops.export.exporter (construct them); re-exported from
          forensic_aul/__init__.py; consumed by callers and the launcher.
Uses    : the standard library only.

These are plain immutable data carriers — no behaviour — kept in their own module
so the orchestration code can import them without a cycle.
