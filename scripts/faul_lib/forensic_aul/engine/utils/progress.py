"""Reusable progress reporting for long-running operations.

A single, UI-agnostic standard for the whole project. Any long operation
(``extract`` today; ``export`` / ``identify`` / ``verify`` tomorrow) declares
its **weighted phases** once, then reports fractional progress within the
current phase. The reporter turns that into a single overall ``0.0 … 1.0``
fraction and forwards a :class:`ProgressEvent` to a *sink*. The core never
imports a UI — the CLI, the GUI, or a test each supply their own sink.

Design
------
- **Phases with weights** so the overall bar covers the *entire* operation, not
  just its longest loop. Steps that have no natural sub-progress (a monolithic
  SQL statement) simply jump from 0 → 1 within their phase; the weight keeps the
  overall bar moving sensibly.
- **Sink is just a callable** ``Callable[[ProgressEvent], None]``. ``None`` means
  "no progress wanted" and every reporter call becomes a cheap no-op, so callers
  never need ``if progress is not None`` guards around their work.
- **Two ready-made sinks**: :func:`tty_bar_sink` (a live one-line bar, rendered
  only on a real terminal so it never pollutes a pipe or the forensic log file)
  and :func:`logging_progress_sink` (emits an INFO line every N %, which lands in
  the audit log). A GUI provides its own sink that updates a progress widget.

Example
-------
    reporter = ProgressReporter(sink, [("parse", 0.7), ("write", 0.3)])
    reporter.phase("parse")
    for i, item in enumerate(items, 1):
        ...                                   # do work
        reporter.update(i / len(items), f"{i}/{len(items)}")
    reporter.phase("write")
    ...
    reporter.finish()

Used by : forensic_aul/extract.py (run_extract) and any future long operation;
          launcher/* and gui/* supply sinks.
Uses    : the standard library only.
